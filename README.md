# Underscore.js Learning Project

This project is designed to help you learn and implement important underscore.js methods, jQuery techniques, and advanced JavaScript concepts.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file with UI for testing
- `css/styles.css` - Styling for the test runner UI
- `js/underscore-methods.js` - Underscore method implementations (YOUR WORK HERE)
- `js/jquery-exercises.js` - jQuery exercises and challenges
- `js/advanced-topics.js` - Advanced JavaScript topics including arguments object, deep diving into objects, etc.
- `js/test-runner.js` - Automated test runner for all implementations

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. You'll see tabs for different categories of methods
3. Click "Run All Tests" to see which implementations are missing
4. Implement the methods in the respective JS files
5. Each method has detailed instructions in comments

## What You'll Learn

### Underscore.js Methods
- **Collections**: each, map, reduce, find, filter
- **Arrays**: first, last, indexOf, uniq, flatten
- **Functions**: bind, delay, throttle, debounce, once
- **Objects**: keys, values, extend, pick, omit

### jQuery Skills
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling and delegation
- Animations
- AJAX patterns
- Form handling

### Advanced JavaScript
- Arguments object manipulation
- Custom array method implementations
- Deep cloning and merging
- Function composition and currying
- Memoization
- Event emitters

## Tips

1. Start with the simpler methods and work your way up
2. Use the test cases to understand expected behavior
3. Don't look at underscore.js source code initially - try to implement from scratch
4. For jQuery exercises, experiment in the playground area
5. The advanced topics build on earlier concepts, so complete them in order

## Testing

- Tests run automatically when you click "Run All Tests"
- Green tests have passed, red tests have failed
- Failed tests show error messages to help debug
- You can run tests for individual categories by refreshing and checking specific tabs
